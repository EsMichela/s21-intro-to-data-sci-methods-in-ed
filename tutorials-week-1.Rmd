```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## First, let's install and load ggplot2 

We'll do so by running the following line of code; click the green arrow to the
right to run the code!

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Next, we'll "load" ggplot2, or check it out for use in our current analysis / R 
session. Run this next chunk the same way as the first:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Print a built-in dataset, txhousing

Next, simply run txhousing to view a dataset built-in to R:

```{r}
txhousing
```
