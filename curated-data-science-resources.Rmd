### What this resource is

- These resources are two zooarchaeological reports, one authored by Frank J. Dirrigl, Jr. and the other by Y.M. Lam, Xingbin Chen, and O.M. Pearson, that analyzed the bone mineral densities of 'gallinaceous' birds and a selection of bovids, cervids, and equids, respectively. The former used a DEXA (dual energy X-ray bone densitometer) and the latter used a CT scanner to derive bone mineral density calculations for their selected taxa. I used these measurements in my final report as comparative specimens; they were incredibly helpful because they went into great detail about how the measurements were derived, and made anayalzying fragemented bones possible due to the fact that mutiple scan sites were measured across one bone.

The third link is a collection of resoruces, collected by Professor David L. Carlson at TAMU, for arcaheologists concerning how to download R and then how to use its statistical packages for arcaheological research. I perused this a bit and it helped me wrap my head around the analyses going on in the first two reports about bone mineral density.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Zooarchaeologists who are doing similar studies on survivorship of faunal remains would find these reosurces helpful. I relaize it is a very niche audience, but R has become very popular within various specialities of archaeology as a data viz, data analysis, and mapping tool due to its 'open source nature'; having relaible datasets such as these readily available on GitHub without having to hunt through the vast academic literature would be very helpful for said researchers.

### Advice on how to use

- The tables and diagrams in the reports are fairly starightforward; they provide illustrations of each element with the various scan sites depicted, and then provide tables gving the bone mineral densities of each scan site. Multiple 'types' of density measurements are provided, but the best/most useful measurement is pointed out for sake of convenience. 
- The resources collected by Prof. Carlson are excellent guides for getting started doing analyses in R similar to what this class did, albeit aimed at archaeology instead of education. These resources provide examples of datasets used by archaeologists in R, which is helpful in that a student would not have to hunt down or create their own dataset (like I did!).

## R-bloggers is a good source for R begginers to learn new skills

Link to resource: https://www.r-bloggers.com
Justin Rose

### What this resource is

- This source has a tremendous amount of different blogs or articles to help R begginners. For instance, it has a blog about using Twitter API within R to collect tweets. It also has a blog about a tutorials to help individuals know how to conduct logistic regression in R. As you can see, this source has an article about various different things to help you use R to your full capacity. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Honestly, if you are looking for any tips relating to almost anything wihtin R, this would be a good source. It does not only cover specific programs within R. It does it best to cover everything that you are trying to do within the program. 

### Advice on how to use

- The front page of this source has all the most recent articles written for the site. If you are looking for tutorials, the tutorials tab is conveniently located at the top of the page. Lastly, there is also a section for R related jobs. 

## Multiple Mean Imputation for Factored or Numerical Data

Link to resource: [https://datascienceplus.com/handling-missing-data-with-mice-package-a-simple-approach/ ]
[Marissa Bartmess]

### What this resource is

- This article walks you through imputation with factor and numerical data and also shows you how to save the imputations to a completed new dataset for use. Also gives you code to use to check your new dataset for missingness (to make sure your imputations worked!)

### Who will find this resource helpful

-Any R novice will find this article helpful. It goes step by step and you can even copy their example code from the website and paste the code into your RMD documents with ease.
### Advice on how to use

- You will need the dplyr and mice packages installed and loaded to follow along with this tutorial. You will also use the sapply function (part of base R). 

## Cheat Sheet on Data Wrangling Using the Tidyverse

Link to resource: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
Sarah Narvaiz

### What this resource is

- This is quite literal a one-page (front and back) cheat sheet on using different functions in R within the Tidyvese for data wrangling purposes. It's helpful to have bookmarked, saved on your computer, or printed and tacked in your study space. It shows you the different functions within the tidyverse and how they can be used for wrangling/tidying data with examples. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Any person who is new to the Tidyverse and any person who is not new to the tidyverse but who sometimes forget the structure of a function or the different types of functions within the Tidyverse which can be used for tidying data.

### Advice on how to use

- This is a cheat sheet that would be permitted to be used during a coding exam. It's succinct but has quite a bit of information. If additional description for the tidyverse function is needed, the user could type ?[function] in their console to get additional information. This resource is a good and quick go-to for a refresher and brief understanding.
