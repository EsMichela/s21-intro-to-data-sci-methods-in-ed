## Financial Analysis Package, data access and cool graphs

Link to resource: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html

### What this resource is

- Quantmod is a package that makes analyzing financial information easier in R. First of all, it allows you to pull financial information straight form Yahoo finance. This data is already in a time series format, which means that it doesn't need to be converted. That's helpful so that you can do further analysis or plotting for time series data. This package also includes some different financial plots, one of which look like it can do a normal line chart of stock data (this can be open, close, high, or low data), but it can also add what looks to be like a kernal density plot line as well. The kernal density allows you to see the trajectory of the stock a little more clearly. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Anyone interested in examining financial data in R will find this useful. Using the quantmod package was not difficult at all and it makes access and analyzing data really simple. The complicated R comes when you try to do deeper analyses on stock data, including forecasting. 

### Advice on how to use

- Honestly, I have read so many sources about how to use quantmod. Specifically, I looked up the correct code to use the getSymbols function that allows you to pull the data, as well as how to correctly structure the beginning date you want to pull the data from. Also, just google some of the graphs that you can use using the quantmod packages. You will find tons of resources and it appears to be a really popular package.
