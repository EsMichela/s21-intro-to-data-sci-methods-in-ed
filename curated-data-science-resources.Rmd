## Financial Analysis Package, data access and cool graphs

Link to resource: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html

Mason Boyd 

### What this resource is

- Quantmod is a package that makes analyzing financial information easier in R. First of all, it allows you to pull financial information straight form Yahoo finance. This data is already in a time series format, which means that it doesn't need to be converted. That's helpful so that you can do further analysis or plotting for time series data. This package also includes some different financial plots, one of which look like it can do a normal line chart of stock data (this can be open, close, high, or low data), but it can also add what looks to be like a kernal density plot line as well. The kernal density allows you to see the trajectory of the stock a little more clearly. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Anyone interested in examining financial data in R will find this useful. Using the quantmod package was not difficult at all and it makes access and analyzing data really simple. The complicated R comes when you try to do deeper analyses on stock data, including forecasting. 

### Advice on how to use

- Honestly, I have read so many sources about how to use quantmod. Specifically, I looked up the correct code to use the getSymbols function that allows you to pull the data, as well as how to correctly structure the beginning date you want to pull the data from. Also, just google some of the graphs that you can use using the quantmod packages. You will find tons of resources and it appears to be a really popular package. 

## Bone Mineral Density measurements of common North American taxa, and Statistics for Archaeologists

### What this resource is

- These resources are two zooarchaeological reports, one authored by Frank J. Dirrigl, Jr. and the other by Y.M. Lam, Xingbin Chen, and O.M. Pearson, that analyzed the bone mineral densities of 'gallinaceous' birds and a selection of bovids, cervids, and equids, respectively. The former used a DEXA (dual energy X-ray bone densitometer) and the latter used a CT scanner to derive bone mineral density calculations for their selected taxa. I used these measurements in my final report as comparative specimens; they were incredibly helpful because they went into great detail about how the measurements were derived, and made anayalzying fragemented bones possible due to the fact that mutiple scan sites were measured across one bone.

The third link is a collection of resoruces, collected by Professor David L. Carlson at TAMU, for arcaheologists concerning how to download R and then how to use its statistical packages for arcaheological research. I perused this a bit and it helped me wrap my head around the analyses going on in the first two reports about bone mineral density.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Zooarchaeologists who are doing similar studies on survivorship of faunal remains would find these reosurces helpful. I relaize it is a very niche audience, but R has become very popular within various specialities of archaeology as a data viz, data analysis, and mapping tool due to its 'open source nature'; having relaible datasets such as these readily available on GitHub without having to hunt through the vast academic literature would be very helpful for said researchers.

### Advice on how to use

- The tables and diagrams in the reports are fairly starightforward; they provide illustrations of each element with the various scan sites depicted, and then provide tables gving the bone mineral densities of each scan site. Multiple 'types' of density measurements are provided, but the best/most useful measurement is pointed out for sake of convenience. 
- The resources collected by Prof. Carlson are excellent guides for getting started doing analyses in R similar to what this class did, albeit aimed at archaeology instead of education. These resources provide examples of datasets used by archaeologists in R, which is helpful in that a student would not have to hunt down or create their own dataset (like I did!).

## R-bloggers is a good source for R begginers to learn new skills

Link to resource: https://www.r-bloggers.com
Justin Rose

### What this resource is

- This source has a tremendous amount of different blogs or articles to help R begginners. For instance, it has a blog about using Twitter API within R to collect tweets. It also has a blog about a tutorials to help individuals know how to conduct logistic regression in R. As you can see, this source has an article about various different things to help you use R to your full capacity. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Honestly, if you are looking for any tips relating to almost anything wihtin R, this would be a good source. It does not only cover specific programs within R. It does it best to cover everything that you are trying to do within the program. 

### Advice on how to use

- The front page of this source has all the most recent articles written for the site. If you are looking for tutorials, the tutorials tab is conveniently located at the top of the page. Lastly, there is also a section for R related jobs. 

## Multiple Mean Imputation for Factored or Numerical Data

Link to resource: [https://datascienceplus.com/handling-missing-data-with-mice-package-a-simple-approach/ ]
[Marissa Bartmess]

### What this resource is

- This article walks you through imputation with factor and numerical data and also shows you how to save the imputations to a completed new dataset for use. Also gives you code to use to check your new dataset for missingness (to make sure your imputations worked!)

### Who will find this resource helpful

-Any R novice will find this article helpful. It goes step by step and you can even copy their example code from the website and paste the code into your RMD documents with ease.
### Advice on how to use

- You will need the dplyr and mice packages installed and loaded to follow along with this tutorial. You will also use the sapply function (part of base R). 

## Cheat Sheet on Data Wrangling Using the Tidyverse

Link to resource: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
Sarah Narvaiz

### What this resource is

- This is quite literal a one-page (front and back) cheat sheet on using different functions in R within the Tidyvese for data wrangling purposes. It's helpful to have bookmarked, saved on your computer, or printed and tacked in your study space. It shows you the different functions within the tidyverse and how they can be used for wrangling/tidying data with examples. 

### Advice on how to use

- This is a cheat sheet that would be permitted to be used during a coding exam. It's succinct but has quite a bit of information. If additional description for the tidyverse function is needed, the user could type ?[function] in their console to get additional information. This resource is a good and quick go-to for a refresher and brief understanding. 

## Mapping Resource from GitHub: this resource walks through the step-by-step process of building maps in R using GGPlot and GGMaps. 
Link to resource: https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/lectures/making-maps-with-R.html 
**Anna Jackson** 

### What this resource is

- This resource provides simple and transferable instructions/tips to making map formats using the package ggmap. 
ggmap has the capability of importing base maps from Google and or the ability to incorporate imported coordinate data. This resource also uses functions from ggplot2 to incorporate data layers (i.e., census data). 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- This resource is for someone who only has basic R skills/knowledge. This package uses spatial data (i.e., longitude and latitude coordinates) to build maps. The ggplot2 and ggmap packages allows users to make a variety of maps, from simple to complex. 

### Advice on how to use

- Even though my project did not require all aspects of this specific mapping resource, I found it most helpful to walk through the entire document and complete each step. This allowed me to familiarize myself with the packages and built my confidence for when it came time to execute my actual project. Extra practice is always useful. Here is  additional links that was also helpful for creating maps in R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html;http://www.nickeubank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RGIS3_MakingMaps_part1_mappingVectorData.html.
