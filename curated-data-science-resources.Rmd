Esther Michela

### What this resource is

- The Tigris package helps you work with files after you download shapefiles from the US census as sf objects, which means they are very detailed, accurate, and inclusive for all US states and territories. You can select specific regions, or states, counties to use, which makes it nice if you need a large or small area for a map.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- This will be a helpful tool for anyone looking to map data related to the United States. It gives you access to complete data on US territories that can be plotted on using latitude and longitudinal data. 

### Advice on how to use
- To download the shape files, use
- 'download.file("http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2015/shp/cb_2015_us_state_20m.zip", destfile = "states.zip")
- 'unzip("states.zip")'
- Tigris works well with ggplot2, so it should be fairly straightforward to work with in terms of layering points, titles, etc. It may be a little hard to install as normal, so use 'devtools::install_github('walkerke/tigris')' if it's not working.
