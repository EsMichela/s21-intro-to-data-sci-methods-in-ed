# Welcome!

Welcome to *week 5*!

**Record the meeting** 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)

library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

# Breakout rooms!

Starting with whomever is most advanced in one's graduate program:

**One question:**

- What kinds of visualization do you find useful/interesting?

**One reflection/discussion:**

Below, what is the a) data, b) function(s), c) argument name(s), and d) argument(s)?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
state_data_final <- state_data_merge %>% 
  complete(state, year = 2011:2020) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  fill(adopted, year_month)
```

### Review of last week's class

**Last week we discussed wrangling and tidying data**:

1. Reshaping data
  - `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()`
1. Joining data
  - `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, and others
1. Grouped data operations with dplyr
  - `group_by()` and `summarize()`

### This week's topics

**Overview**

1. Introduction to data viz
2. A bit more tidying data
3. Data ethics

We are by no means done with the data tidying functions we discussed last week!

### 1. Intro to Data Viz

**Outline**

A. Why visualize data?
B. How can we visualize data in R?
C. And, how can we make our visualizations aesthetically pleasing?

# 1A: Why visualize data?

One answer: 

"You should look at your data." ([Healy, 2018](https://socviz.co/))

*To elaborate on this*:

- Visualizations allow to _understand the structure and nature of your data_, and to begin to understand what might relate to what else
- Just like we want to be constantly looking at our data in its spreadsheet/table/data frame format (e.g., `str()`, `glimpse()`, and `View()`), visualizing our data can help us to make sure our data contains what we think it does-and it can alert us to when it does not

# 1A: Why visualize data?

These four different data sets have the same correlation (type `anscombe` in R to view the data), but are very different

```{r, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://socviz.co/dataviz-pdfl_files/figure-html4/ch-01-anscombe-1.png")
```

---

# 1A: Why visualize data

Another reason to visualize data is to *communicate with others*; you can use visualizations to communicate your findings or results. In example:

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides_files/figure-html/bar1-1.png")
```
---

```{r, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides_files/figure-html/bar8-1.png")
```

# 1B: How to visualize data

One way to think about visualizing data is in terms of the _type_ of visualization you create:

- Histogram
- Density plot
- Scatter plot
- Bar chart
- Pie chart ([gasp!](https://socviz.co/refineplots.html))
- Time series plot/line chart

---

# 1B: How to visualize data

Another way to think about visualizing data is in terms of the elements that make up a plot.

The *grammar of graphics* ([Wickham, 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), [Wilkinson, 2012](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21551-3_13)) has a particular answer to the question of what a plot includes:

Why a grammar of graphics?

- gain insight into complex figures
- reveal deeper relationships between what may appear to be unrelated visualizations
- more flexibly and creatively visualize data--including in ways that do not fit well into one type of plot
- suggest what makes a good figure

# 1B: How to visualize data?

One view of visualizations is that they consist of four components:

1. Data
2. One or more geometric objects (shape, point, line, etc.)
3. A mapping between variables in the data and the geometric objects and their characteristics (including their size and color)
4. A theme

# 1B: How to visualize data?

Let's see how this might appear:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# create a dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name=c( rep("A",500), rep("B",500), rep("B",500), rep("C",20), rep('D', 100)  ),
  value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) )
) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

```{r}
data
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter()
```

---

# 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter()
```

---

# 1B: How to visualize data

You can easily create different plots by:

- Changing the aesthetic _mapping_ between variables in the data and geometric objects
- Changing the geometric objects

# 1C: How to make visualizations aesthetically pleasing

_Theming and fine-tuning_

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(color="black", size=0.4, alpha=0.9) +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=11)
    ) +
  theme_bw()
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value, fill = name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(color="black", size=0.4, alpha=0.9) +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=11)
    ) +
  theme_bw()
```

# Part 2/3: A bit more tidying data

### 2: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

Often, we have to make changes to our data frame in order to create the visualization we would like to create.
