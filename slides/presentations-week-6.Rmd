# Breakout rooms!

Starting with whomever most wants to go first:

**One question:**

- What is a weird, unusual, or surprising situation you encountered when using R in the last week?

**One reflection/discussion:**

- What is a specific visualization you would like to create - and why?

### Review of last week's class

Why visualize data?

One answer: 

"You should look at your data." ([Healy, 2018](https://socviz.co/))

*To elaborate on this*:

- Visualizations allow to _understand the structure and nature of your data_, and to begin to understand what might relate to what else
- Just like we want to be constantly looking at our data in its spreadsheet/table/data frame format (e.g., `str()`, `glimpse()`, and `View()`), visualizing our data can help us to make sure our data contains what we think it does-and it can alert us to when it does not

### Review of last week's class

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# create a dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name=c( rep("Question 1",500), rep("Question 2",500), rep("Question 3",500), rep("Question 4",20), rep('Question 5', 100)  ),
  value=c( rnorm(500, 3, 1), rnorm(500, 2, .5), rnorm(500, 3.1, 1), rnorm(20, 4, 2), rnorm(100, 6, 1.5) )
) %>%

# Part 1/3: Data Viz Ideas

---

### 1. Data Viz Ideas

**Outline**

A. Review of the grammar of graphics

B. Understanding visualizations by layers

C. Understanding mapping of data to geoms

---

### 1A: Grammar of Graphics

Another way to think about visualizing data is in terms of the elements that make up a plot.

The *grammar of graphics* ([Wickham, 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), [Wilkinson, 2012](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21551-3_13)) has a particular answer to the question of what a plot includes:

Why a grammar of graphics?

- gain insight into complex figures
- reveal deeper relationships between what may appear to be unrelated visualizations
- more flexibly and creatively visualize data--including in ways that do not fit well into one type of plot
- suggest what makes a good figure

  "Buildings and administration", 0.22,
  "Labor", 0.31,
  "Machinery", 0.27,

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

Layers:

1. Data
2. One or more geometric objects (shape, point, line, etc.)
3. A mapping between variables in the data and the geometric objects and their characteristics (including their size and color)
4. A theme

---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_Data_

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(mtcars)
```


---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_One geom_

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg))
```


---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_Additional Geoms_

```{r, out.width = "50%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), method = "loess")
```

---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_Additional Aesthetic Parameters: Color_

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% mutate(am = as.factor(am))
```


```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = am), size = 6)
```
---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_Additional Aesthetic Parameters: Shape_ 

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, shape = am), size = 6) +
  geom_point()
```

---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = am), size = 6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Displacement") +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Transmission", labels = c("manual", "auto"))
```


---

### 1B: Understanding visualizations by layer

_Theme: overall_

```{r, out.width = "50%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = am), size = 6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Displacement") +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Transmission", labels = c("manual", "auto")) +
  theme_bw()
```

---

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width = "50%", message = FALSE}
library(ggthemes)

base_plot <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = am), size = 6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), method = "loess") +

base_plot + theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

---

You can create different plots by:

- Changing the aesthetic _mapping_ between variables in the data and geometric objects
- Changing the geometric objects


---

### 1C: Understanding mapping data to geoms

_Changing the mapping_

```{r, out.width = "50%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(y = disp, x = mpg, color = am), size = 6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = disp, x = mpg), method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Displacement") +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Transmission", labels = c("manual", "auto")) +
  theme_bw()
```

---

### 1C: Understanding mapping data to geoms

_Changing geoms_

```{r, out.width = "50%", message = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_rug(aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = am), size = 6) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = disp, y = mpg), method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Displacement") +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Transmission", labels = c("manual", "auto")) +

# Part 3/3: Data Viz and Tidying

---

### 3: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

Often, we have to make changes to our data frame in order to create the visualization we would like to create.

**Making a new variable prior to plotting the data**

_Other data tidying steps_ we might take prior to visualizing data:

  - **recoding** variables
  - **creating a factor** (so that we can order elements of a plot as we wish for them
  to be ordered)
  - **grouping** and **summarizing** to plot a summary statistic
  - realizing that your data processing and tidying was not quite sufficient,
  so **returning to those stages** before finalizing your visualization
  - **re-running our analysis** (`.Rmd` file) because we discovered an issue with our 
  data
  
---

### 3: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

Sometimes we need to recode a variable

---

### 3: How does tidying data relate to data viz?


Reordering factors is often a good way to get what we want


---

### 3: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

When we do `group_by()` and `summarize()`
